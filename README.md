This project analyze weekly credit card transaction and customer data to track revenue, interest earned, income distribution, and spending behaviour and to develop a comprehensive credit card weekly dashboard that provides real-time insights into key performance metrics and trends, enabling stakeholders to monitor and analyze credit card operations effectively.


### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Gathering the Data files required to perform analysis.

- Step 2 : Importing data tables into database and perform necessary queries.

- Step 3 : Connected PowerBI to Microsoft SQL Server to import data from the database.
           
- Step 4 : Data Preparation: Performed Data cleaning and transforming data using Power Query Editor. The Process included:

        - Configured data types according to the data in each column.
        - Filtered rows and created additional columns to support data.
        - Created Measures Table and important measures to support analysis.
        - Removed null and duplicate records in Power Query.

- Step 5 : Created new columns for the Customer Credit Table to asist the analysis.

        1 - Age_Group = 

        SWITCH(
        TRUE(),
        customer[Customer_Age]<30,"20-30",
        customer[Customer_Age]>=30 && customer[Customer_Age]<40,"30-40",
        customer[Customer_Age]>=40 && customer[Customer_Age]<50,"40-50",
        customer[Customer_Age]>=50 && customer[Customer_Age]<60,"50-60",
        customer[Customer_Age]>=60,"60+",
        "Invalid")

        2 - Income_Grade =

        SWITCH(
        TRUE(),
        customer[Income]<35000,"C",
        customer[Income]>=35000 && customer[Income]<70000,"B",
        customer[Income]>=70000,"A")

        3 - Total_Revenue = 

        credit_card[Annual_Fees] + credit_card[Total_Trans_Amt] + credit_card[Interest_Earned]

- Step 6 : DAX Measures created for analysis:

        1 - Curr_Week_Revenue: 
        
        CALCULATE(SUM(credit_card[Total_Revenue]),
        FILTER(ALL(credit_card),
        credit_card[Week_No] = MAX(credit_card[Week_No])))

        2 - Previous_Week_Revenue:

        CALCULATE(SUM(credit_card[Total_Revenue],
        FILTER(ALL(credit_card),
        credit_card[Week_No] = MAX(credit_card[Week_No])-1))

        3 - wow_revenue: 

        DIVIDE(([Curr_Week_Revenue] -   [Previous_Week_Revenue]),
        [Previous_Week_Revenue])

- Step 7 : Final Dashboard:
